# Block 2 - R for Data Science

The book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is well-known as the "bible" to start with.

Use the free online version of this book and read the following chapters, making sure to try the code examples yourself. I highly encourage you to type the code in RStudio rather than copying and pasting it, as this will give you a more authentic experience of coding in R.
