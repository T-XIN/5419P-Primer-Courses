## About this course

This self-paced primer course is designed to equip you with the foundational knowledge and coding skills in Python and R, ensuring you have a strong starting point as you embark on your MSc Data Analytics Degree Apprenticeship journey. In addition to key concepts, you will be introduced to the python and R ecosystems for data science, particularly Numpy for numerical computing and Pandas for manipulation and analysis of tabular data.

The coursework material is a compilation of content from different resources, primarily textbooks. You are expected to work through the material at your own pace and complete the proposed practice/self-assessment exercises. Note, however, that these exercises **are not marked**.
