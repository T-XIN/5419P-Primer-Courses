# Block 2 Part 1 - Jupyter notebooks

Last week you were introduced to Anaconda and Python. You wrote and executed Python code
interactively, using the IPython shell, and non-interactively using a text editor (to write your
python program) and the terminal (to execute it). This week you begin using the most popular way of
writing Python code interactively among scientists and academics: Jupyter Notebooks.

There are two main goals in this section:

1. Launch Jupyter notebook from Anaconda (either navigator or console).
2. Create a new notebook (Python 3).
3. Read through the Jupyter notebook user [documentation
   page](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html) and run through some of
   the notebook examples provided
   [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/examples_index.html)
   to get acquainted with the interface and components of a Jupyter notebook.

In part 2, you will continue to develop your Python essentials but now using the Jupyter notebook
environment.
