# Block2 Part 2 - Python Data Structures

Welcome to part 2 of block 2. You will continue to learn about the Python language and develop your
coding skills through practice.

For each theme there is a suggested textbook resource for you to read through. A very important
directive is that you **should reproduce the python statements and programs shown in the book as you
go along**. This will help you get used to running Python code and gain familiarity with the
language and its syntax. Try not to just read through the text without writing any code. 

Note that, in this part, you should use **Jupyter Notebooks** to reproduce the python code presented
to you in the book.
