# Block 4 Part 1 - Intro to pandas

Reading list:

- [Package overview](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html)
- [What kind of data does pandas handle](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html)

Mckinney's book - *Python for data analysis : Data wrangling with pandas, numpy, and ipython*:

- [Chapter 5](pdf/mckinney_ch5.pdf)
- [Chapter 6](pdf/mckinney_ch6.pdf)
  (Section 6.1, until page 175 excluding)

Again, it is important to write code as you read and learn about pandas. For this section, I
recommend running the code interactively in a Jupyter notebook where you can execute the code in
steps, append notes and save it for later.
